00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.182
OLDER TED: So there was this one night,
before I met your mother,

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.218
when I really wanted to go to the bar.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.754
The bar. Big surprise.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.983
You sure spent a lot of time in bars.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.059
Well, that's just what we did back then.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.187
<i>Me, Marshall and Lily, Barney, Robin,</i>

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.858
<i>We all used to hang out</i>
<i>at this one bar called MacLaren's,</i>

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.598
<i>But then one night,,,</i>

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.137
- Why don't we go to MacLaren's?
- Let's go to MacLaren's.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.537
You guys talking to each other?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.510
- Nobody's listening?
- What's wrong with MacLaren's?

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:48.477
MacLaren's is bore snore.
Ted, tonight we're gonna go out.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.109
We're gonna meet some ladies,
it's gonna be legendary. Phone-five!

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.651
<i>OLDER TED; I had no idea</i>
<i>why I hung out with Barney,</i>

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:02.390
You didn't phone-five, did you?
I know when you don't phone-five, Ted.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.495
Come on. We always go to MacLaren's.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.566
Yeah, 'cause MacLaren's is fun.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.897
MacLaren's is this much fun.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.099
What I'm offering
is the chance to have this much fun.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.869
See, you say that.
You say it's gonna be this much fun,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.911
but most of the time,
it ends up being this much fun.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.811
This much fun is good. It's safe.
It's guaranteed.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.407
This hand-gesture thing
doesn't really work on the phone, does it?

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.042
No, it doesn't.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.815
Get in the cab. Marshall, you, too.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.982
I wish I could.
I think Lily and I are just gonna...

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.822
- I understand. Get in the cab.
- Why can Marshall say no?

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.987
Because he's getting laid.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.020
Consistently.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.725
Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.633
You keep going to the same bar.
You're in a rut.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:48.070
And I am a rut-buster.
I'm going to bust your rut.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.639
It's not a rut, okay?
It's a routine and I like it.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.137
Ted, what's the first syllable in "rut-tine"?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.980
Peace out, suckers!

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.423
All right, so what's this legendary plan?

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.326
First, we gotta pick someone up
at the airport.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.865
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Estaban, doors!

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.365
Okay, we just do this one little thing
and the rest of the night is ours.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.034
Why do you have those suitcases
and who are we picking up?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.079
I don't know. Maybe her. Or her.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.574
Wait. So, when you said you were
going to pick someone up at the airport,

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:35.552
you meant you were going to
pick someone up at the airport?

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.248
Scenario.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.690
Couple of girls fly into town
looking for a fun weekend in NYC

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.660
when they meet two handsome
international businessmen

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.231
just back from a lucrative trip to Japan.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.498
Sample dialog. You have a wheelie bag?

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.593
Why, I have a wheelie bag.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.763
- You've got to be kidding me.
- False.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.501
Sidebar. Tuck in your shirt.
You look sketchy.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.204
- I'm sketchy?
- Trust me, it's gonna be legendary.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.711
Don't say legendary, okay?

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.248
You're too liberal with the word legendary.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.884
We're building an igloo in Central Park.
It's gonna be legendary.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.454
Snowsuit up!

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.287
Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here!

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.784
This is happening.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.623
Now, you can either put the bags
on the carousel now

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.629
or you can listen to me
give you a really long speech

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.495
convincing you to put the bags
on the carousel. Your move.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.268
Ted, since the dawn of time,
mankind has struggled...

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.677
<i>That night,</i>
<i>Marshall had a ton of studying to do,</i>

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.075
<i>So, Lily went out with Robin</i>

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.739
<i>who was new to New York</i>
<i>and looking for a friend,</i>

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.839
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out,

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.384
- just the two of us.
- Yeah.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.646
And you sure you're okay
giving up your Friday night

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.915
to hang with an old, almost-married lady?

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.355
Oh, please.
I'm so sick of the meat-market scene.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.892
Guys are like the subway.

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.360
You miss one,
another one comes along in five minutes.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:53.694
Unless it's the end of the night,
and then you get on anything.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.069
Compliments of that guy.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.207
Really? Sweet.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.037
Oh. For you it's $6.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.012
I guess that's one drawback
to being engaged.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.605
- I'm sure that's why he did it.
- Hey.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.350
Oh, hello.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.250
So, did you just get in from Detroit?

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.057
Japan.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.563
Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready?

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:36.074
'Cause I'm about to drop some knowledge.
Cute girls are not from Buffalo.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.434
Time out. Ten o'clock.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.673
You ready to rock this, Tedder?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.941
All right, I think we need to refine
our back-story first.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.075
- How did we...
- Ted! You klutzy, great guy you!

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.653
Hey. Barney.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.918
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.186
- I am so sorry.
- It's fine, no.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.559
You were a little shaky on your landing.
I'd give you a 9.2.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.991
Hi, I'm Ted.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.623
Laura. Look, I'm really sorry
that we have to hit and run,

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:02.928
but we've got a plane to catch.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.867
- Oh, where are you headed?
- Philadelphia.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.906
- Philly? That's where we're headed.
- You are?

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.967
- Well, then, we'll see you on the plane.
- Yes, you will.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.876
- Follow them. Tickets on me.
- No. Barney!

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.281
Don't you get on that escalator!

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.947
And don't you dare
get on that subsequent escalator!

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.136
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.110
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:59.384
Hey, guess where I am? I'm on a... Ready?
Plane to... Ready? Philadelphia.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.052
- That is awesome.
- Hey, is that Marshall?

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:03.458
Marshall, stop whatever you're doing,

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:06.031
get in that hoopty-ass Fiero of yours
and come meet us in Philly.

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.429
It's gonna be legendary!

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.398
Man, I wish I could, guys...

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:12.266
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sent you
some pictures on my phone. Check it.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.238
Philly!

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.374
Admit it, you're having fun.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.918
This much... 35,000 feet of fun.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.713
Well, I didn't think
I'd be flying to Philadelphia

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.549
when I woke up this morning,
I'll give you that.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.850
Attaboy. Now let's go talk to those girls.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.721
Wait, wait. The seat-belt sign's on.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:37.887
Ted, you've been living your whole life
in a seat belt.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.726
It's time to unclick.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.965
- Sir, seat-belt light's on.
- Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:49.774
Well, I grew up in Park Slope.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.606
Oh, I love Park Slope.
When did you move to Manhattan?

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.340
- You're from Park Slope?
- No, she is.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:58.313
So, where are you from? Heaven?

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.279
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:03.150
I died 15 years ago, like that pick-up line.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.990
- God, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, believe me, I've been there.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.962
I have this line that I use
when guys come up... Check it out.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.357
Hey.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.262
You take this one,
I'll save it for the next one.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:23.207
- So, what brings you guys to Philly?
- We're visiting our boyfriends.

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:25.800
I think Chris is gonna propose
this weekend.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:28.446
Isn't that great?

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.343
So great.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:36.953
<i>So, there we were,</i>

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.719
<i>stuck on an airplane to Philadelphia</i>
<i>with two very un-single girls,</i>

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.692
<i>All thanks to your Uncle Barney,</i>

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.228
Aren't they cute?

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.493
- They're both linebackers for the Eagles.
- Both!

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.433
Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.536
You're going to Philly? Why?

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.276
I didn't ask.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:02.139
Well, it sounds like
you're having a lot more fun than I am.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:05.409
I'm just talking to guys' backs
while they hit on Robin.

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.112
Well, yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.155
Don't you bet I get that a lot?

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.484
Not with a ring on your finger.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:15.687
I mean, you know, guys see the ring,
it's, like, Marshall parking only.

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.455
Oh, of course. That's it. The ring.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.088
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.963
Oh, it's totally the ring.
If you took that ring off your finger

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:25.537
you'd have a ton of guys
crowding your junk.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.572
I'm not gonna take off my ring.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:31.302
Wouldn't you be jealous of guys
swarming all over my beeswax?

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:34.872
Oh, yeah. You know me,
I'm the jealous type.

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:38.041
Any goon so much as looks at you,
I'll sock him in the kisser!

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.482
No, seriously,
you girls have a good time tonight.

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.746
Bye.

Hey, I'm over here.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.300
Going to Philly!

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:59.398
Marshall, don't come to Philly.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:01.200
But we're on an adventure.

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.104
We're on a tarmac in Philadelphia.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.177
Crazy adventure.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.239
Fine.

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:11.747
No. No. The night has just started.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.649
Look, airport bar. Flight attendants.

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.279
They'll get your tray table
in its full, upright position.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.621
- Say what?
- Passengers Mosby and Stinson?

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.250
Please come with us, gentlemen.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:26.161
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Barney, I am going to kill you.

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:29.325

Believe it or not,
that duffle bag thing worked.

The truth is, my friend, he does this thing

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.803
where he goes to airports
with fake luggage to pick up girls.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.805
And we followed some here
to Philadelphia.

Dude, seriously, relax.

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.825
- We at least get to call our lawyer.
- Exactly.

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.323
We have a lawyer?

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.300
Listen to me.
You're both American citizens.

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:46.599
Don't let them pull any Patriot-Act voodoo.
You both retain the right

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.072
to refuse to answer any questions
without an attorney present.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.234
So don't say anything
until I get there, all right?

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:52.571

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:53.351
So, fine.

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:57.724
If you wanna go home, then we'll go home.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.724
(SIGHING)

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.197
Fine. We'll go lick the Liberty Bell.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.528
Good, 'cause we're here.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:11.737
<i>I had no idea how Barney redirected</i>
<i>the cab without me knowing,</i>

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.811
<i>but we got out, Dana let us in,</i>

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:16.642
<i>and by God, we licked the Liberty Bell,</i>

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:19.648
- And you know what it tastes like?
- What?

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.448
Freedom.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.354
No, actually it tastes like pennies.

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:28.660
Oh, my God. Did you guys really do that?

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.227
<i>OLDER TED; We really did,</i>

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:33.298
<i>And that was when I realized</i>
<i>why I hung out with Barney,</i>

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:38.028
<i>I never got where I thought I wanted to go,</i>
<i>but I always got a great story,</i>

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.375
So, that girl you were talking to,
that was Mom?

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:47.036
Kids, every story in a man's life
is like a dot

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:49.909
- in an impressionist painting, and when...
- So that's a no?

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:51.676
Yeah, that's a no.

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:53.942
What? Come on.

00:20:54.305 --> 00:21:00.882
